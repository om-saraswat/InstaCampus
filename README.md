# Instacampus - Online Canteen & Stationary Ordering System

## 📌 What We Do
Instacampus is a platform that digitizes campus ordering, making it simple for students and vendors to interact.  
Students can:
- Order **canteen food & drinks**
- Buy **stationary or request Xerox/printing services**

Vendors can:
- Manage **inventory, products, and orders**
- Track **sales, restocking, and order statuses**

---

## 💡 Why We Do
- **For Students:** Avoid queues, save time, and access campus services from anywhere.  
- **For Vendors:** Automate order management, reduce manual errors, and get real-time stock insights.  
- **For Campus:** Build a sustainable, tech-driven ecosystem.

## ⚙️ How We Do
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)  
- **Authentication:** JWT + bcrypt (role-based access: student, canteen-vendor, stationary-vendor, admin)  
- **Routers:** Modular design for scalability  
- **Frontend:** Built with React (or Next.js) for real-time ordering & vendor dashboards
